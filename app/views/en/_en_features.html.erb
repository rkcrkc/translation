                  <p>We're native speakers of both English and Chinese... We write like you in English, and we write like you'd want to in Chinese. No stupid translations, no accidently branding yourself something that means "Don't buy us.com", no sloppy mistakes... Fluent in English and Mandarin, we appreciate the cultural nuances that colour both languages. We’re big on making sure that the tone and style of your original copy doesn’t get lost in translation, so that your branding remains consistent across borders.</p>
